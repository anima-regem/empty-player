IMPORTANT: Setup Required for Rive Animation
=============================================

To use the Anime Cat loading animation, you need to:

1. Download a Rive animation file from https://rive.app/community
   - Search for "cat" or "anime" animations
   - Choose one that loops automatically
   
2. Rename the downloaded file to: anime_cat.riv

3. Place it in this directory (assets/)

4. The app will automatically use it when you select "Anime Cat" 
   in Settings > Appearance > Loading Animation

Until you add the file, the app will fall back to the pulsating 
circles animation even if Rive is selected.

Alternative: Create your own animation at https://rive.app
